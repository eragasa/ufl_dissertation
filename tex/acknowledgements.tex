An acknowledgement of the people I would like to thank is necessarily incomplete, but starts with family.  My parents have always supported me throughout my life's adventures, fortunes and misfortunes.  My brother Ferdinand has been my best friend and biggest fan since his birth.

The people who have guided my work and helped me develop myself on this journey are numerous.  I chose to University of Florida to work with Simon Phillpot as my advisor, and I could not have asked for a better experience.  Susan Sinnott was influential early during this process, while Richard Hennig has been an invaluable resource.  I would also like the rest of the members of my committee.

People I have worked with that provided key insight into this project include XXX at Argonne National Laboratory, XXX at Sandia, and XXX and Berkeley Labs.  Finally, I would like to thank David Bai, who supervised me during an internship at Idaho National Labs.

The support of members of the Dr. Phillpot's, Dr. Hennig's, and Dr. Sinnotts research groups have provided friendship and support throughout the years.}
