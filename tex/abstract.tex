\begin{abstract}
The parameterization of a functional form for an interatomic potential is treated as a problem in multi-objective optimization. An autonomous, machine-learning approach based on the identification of the Pareto hypersurface of errors in predicted properties allows the development of an ensemble of parameterizations with high materials fidelity and robustness. The efficacy and flexibility of this approach is illustrated for a Buckingham potential for MgO, a Stillinger-Weber potential for silicon, and an EAM model for nickel.  This approach also provides a strong foundation for uncertainty quantification of potential parameterizations, a more interactive approach for potential selection, and attaining richer datasets for assessing model formalisms.
