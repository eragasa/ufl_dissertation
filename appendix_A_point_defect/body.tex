\appendix{Calculation of Point Defect Energies}

This appendix documents the heuristics and algorithms for the automation for the calculation of point defects.
In theory, point defect calculations are dependent upon the interatomic cutoff of the interatomic potential.
However, the energies of pair-wise interactions vanish quickly due to tails of power-law and expoential distribution functions.
The author has found it instructive that even when the targets of the fitting database are taken from literature, \emph{ab initio} calculations to understand how large the size that the representative volume should be to prevent defect interaction
\section{Calculation of Point Defects}
In ionic materials, the formation of energy of a defect $d$ with charge $q$ is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  E_d^f=E_{def}-E_{perf}=\sum_\alpha n_\alpha \mu_\alpha - q\mu_e + E_{chcor} + E_elcor
\end{equation}
A point defect occur at or around a lattice point, there are not expanded into space in any direction.

A vacancy are lattice sites which would be occupied in a single crystal, but are vacant.  The stability of surrounding crystal structure prevents the atoms from occupying the vacancy.

In an ionic solid, the combination of a two vacanies of a cation and anion species are refrred to as a Schottky defect, which is neutral in nature.

\section{Robustness of Potentials}
Sensitive analysis.  Many models use cutoff-radii as an additional parameter to be determined by the fitting process.  Because of the nature of the stacking fault, the GSF energy must depend upon non-nearest neighbor interactions.
However, a slight alteration of the cutoff-radius was found to have a dramatic impact on the behavior of EAM potentials by Zimmerman.%\cite{Zimmerman2000_Ni_gsf}.
He sugests that parameterizeed models should be only slightly sensitive to a change of value for any of it's parameters.  High sensitivity indicates the possibility of unphysical behavior of a model.  This issue should be address when creating a potential to be used in simulations that involve stacking faults.
